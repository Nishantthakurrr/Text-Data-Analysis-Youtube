Let me hit you all with some knowledge: the N word is not okay to say because it has body counts and a huge amount of human suffering attached to it. The word goes back to slave owning days, same as the N word with no hard r. Black folks can say the word because it is theirs to reclaim. I'm a person of color and that word is not in my vocabulary. Why? Because I'm not black, and I'm aware of the oppression tied to this word. I'm also not a piss baby arguing why I should be able to use such a gross word because again, this word is not mine to reclaim. So yeah, it's fine when all these black rappers use the word because it's a part of their personal history. As a grown ass woman I am still in disbelief that people can't have a pinch of empathy for their fellow human beings. If you're not black, you are irrelevant in the conversation of whether you can say the n word.

Why if we have the technology of cloud seeding through laser shooting at particles to create rain and we been manipulating the weather for decades now. Why didn't we redirected or stopped the hurricanes? \\n\\nEven famous physicists Michio Kaku admits to this geoengenering on a cbs news interview.  \\nI wish it didn't happen and all natural disasters are a horrible thing for anyone to endure. And my heart goes out to all the victims and will continue to support. But it is so sad to find out that tragic events like this can be man made at times. So I pray that many of you become aware of what's really taking place in this reality and give your life to God, he won't disappoint you. \\nAnd I pray that this whole event about helping is not just an agenda to promote and push coexistence, globalism and unity. Their religion of occult  New Age/mysticism and rise of their Antichrist/alien god to bring their New World Order, which they believe, chaos must be created in order to bring Order. Where with their mind witch powers and advance alien/demon technology they can create  almost anything they can imagine. \\nDon't get me wrong please, helping is awesome as I'm praying for everyone including the celebrities participating and even those who have sold their souls for riches and fame, is not to late for redemption! I'm praying for you. But really hope this is not all orchestrated for a different agenda, don't forget that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Time to read our Bibles and take a close look at  the book of Revelation chapter 13,  Daniel 12 and Luke 21.\\nStay strong Texas, Florida, all the Caribbean and to all those affected. May you find peace and joy in Christ Jesus even in the middle of the struggles. Remember man and Satan  can only hurt the physical body or the material but can't never have our souls if we believe we are Gods children and the only way to be redeemed and adopted into Gods family is by Jesus Christ our Savior, there's no short cuts and Satan is a liar so don't fall for the lies because religion kills and condemns the soul, only a true relationship with Father God through Jesus saves.

I explained my problem to my friend and she suggested that I should rather contact a spell caster that could help me cast a spell to bring him back but I am the type that never believed in spell, I had no choice than to try it, I mailed the spell caster, and he told me there was no problem that everything will be okay before three days, that my ex will return to me before three days, he cast the spell and surprisingly in the second day, it was around 4 pm. My ex called me, I was so surprised, I answered the call and all he said was that he was so sorry for everything that happened that he wanted me to return to him, that he loves me so much. I was so happy and went to him that was how we started living together happily again. Since then, I have made promise that anybody I know that have a relationship problem, I would be of help to such person by referring him or her to the only real and powerful spell caster who helped me with my own problem.

Even if you make the point of carrying capacity in terms of food becoming a problem, it could be tackled by GMOs easier and better. Second: You CAN NOT just shrink people down like this. The size of nucleons are unalterable, because the ranges of the strong and weak nuclear forces are fundamental constants. Reducing the space between nuclei and electrons is impossible because of electromagnetism. And even packing molecules tighter together wouldn't work, as there'd be biochemical problems. Correct protein folding and therefore enzymes would be rendered impossible. Third: How could they metabolize food and drinks not their own size? Their tiny enzymes wouldn't work on normal-sized molecules. I'd say if you can alter the fundamental universal constants, carrying capacity is no worry any longer, you're basically beyond even a kardashev III civilization by then. \\n\\nThis isn't even original, as some say. The shrinking trope has been done to death!\\nAnd before someone points out this is supposed to be a comedy: Even a comedy needs suspension of disbelief. Also, it may be because I hate Hollywood comedy to the death, but at least for me they're always the same. Clichee-filled crude humor fests with plots of idiocy.

Se trata de una de las canciones que quedaron guardadas cuando la banda brit√°nica estaba componiendo uno de los √°lbumes m√°s influyentes de su carrera: El OK Computer (1997).\\nDos d√©cadas despu√©s, el tema vio la luz en OKNOTOK. La reedici√≥n incluye el disco original, las 8 caras b y tres temas in√©ditos que el grupo ha tocado en directo pero cuyas versiones de estudio jam√°s han visto la luz. Estas son ‚ÄúMan of War‚Äù y ‚ÄúI Promise‚Äú y Lift, todas ya con su correspondiente nuevo v√≠deoclip.\\nLas im√°genes de Lift est√°n dirigidas por el brit√°nico Oscar Hudson, que ha trabajado con la banda desde el lanzamiento de A Moon Shaped Pool (2016). En este v√≠deoclip vemos un surrealista viaje en ascensor protagonizado por el vocalista del grupo, Thom Yorke.  En el trayecto se encuentra con diversos personajes y situaciones, pero como se indica en la canci√≥n, no todo es lo que parece.\\nM√∫sica independiente novedades.</td>\n",

don\\u2019t goWhen it goes from OK to a oh noWhen it goes from hi five to a low blowWhen it goes from all five to a soloLemme tell you what you don\\u2019t knowI been down / so low / I wasLooking for something but denying that I found itThere\\u2019s an elephant sitting in the roomAnd I can\\u2019t find another way to tiptoe around itI been doing greater good for a long timeBut I can\\u2019t find any other way to give nowI been putting myself on the sidelineAnd it\\u2019s been time so I\\u2019m saying can I live nowThere are times when I kick myselfSay I\\u2019m not sick but I can\\u2019t get wellSay I got this while I chase my tailAs if they can\\u2019t tellI'm running from my shadowRunning from my shadow but it\\u2019s still there chasing me downI\\u2019ll never win the battleNever win the battle and I should have known it by nowJust when I think I\\u2019ve found the end / ohhhI\\u2019m going back around again / ohhhRunning from my shadowRunning from my shadow but it\\u2019s still there chasing me downLight side\\u2019s got a dark side to itDaytime flows into night like fluidThe yin and the yang with a curved line through itAnd none of it\\u2019s illuminating why I do itMaybe I didn\\u2019t want to chase what was not rightMaybe I didn\\u2019t want to face you were offsidesThinking I was far away from a crossed lineBut I was giving soft praise to a hard lieThere are things that you say and you don\\u2019t sayMy tongue\\u2019s gotten real tired of me biting it\\u2018Cause I keep on following the wrong wayTime\\u2019s come and I can\\u2019t keep denying itThere are times when I kick myselfSay I\\u2019m not sick but I can\\u2019t get wellSay I got this while I chase my tailAs if they can\\u2019t tellI'm running from my shadowRunning from my shadow but it\\u2019s still

ohhhRunning from my shadowRunning from my shadow but it\\u2019s still there chasing me downI love you but I know / I gotta let you goDancing with the devil cause she\\u2019s all I\\u2019ve ever knownWanted to pretend / That this time was the endSorry but I guess I gotta let you down againAgainAgainRunning from my shadow now my shadow is my only friendRunning from my shadowBut it\\u2019s

don\\u2019t goWhen it goes from OK to a oh noWhen it goes from hi five to a low blowWhen it goes from all five to a soloLemme tell you what you don\\u2019t knowI been down / so low / I wasLooking for something but denying that I found itThere\\u2019s an elephant sitting in the roomAnd I can\\u2019t find another way to tiptoe around itI been doing greater good for a long timeBut I can\\u2019t find any other way to give nowI been putting myself on the sidelineAnd it\\u2019s been time so I\\u2019m saying can I live nowThere are times when I kick myselfSay I\\u2019m not sick but I can\\u2019t get wellSay I got this while I chase my tailAs if they can\\u2019t tellI'm running from my shadowRunning from my shadow but it\\u2019s still there chasing me downI\\u2019ll never win the battleNever win the battle and I should have known it by nowJust when I think I\\u2019ve found the end / ohhhI\\u2019m going back around again / ohhhRunning from my shadowRunning from my shadow but it\\u2019s still there chasing me downLight side\\u2019s got a dark side to itDaytime flows into night like fluidThe yin and the yang with a curved line through itAnd none of it\\u2019s illuminating why I do itMaybe I didn\\u2019t want to chase what was not rightMaybe I didn\\u2019t want to face you were offsidesThinking I was far away from a crossed lineBut I was giving soft praise to a hard lieThere are things that you say and you don\\u2019t sayMy tongue\\u2019s gotten real tired of me biting it\\u2018Cause I keep on following the wrong wayTime\\u2019s come and I can\\u2019t keep denying itThere are times when I kick myselfSay I\\u2019m not sick but I can\\u2019t get wellSay I got this while I chase my tailAs if they can\\u2019t tellI'm running from my shadowRunning from my shadow but it\\u2019s still
