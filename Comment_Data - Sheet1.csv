cLdxuaxaQwc,Love you Pewdiepie don't apologize your fine,0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,"I am seeing so much idiocy and lack of self awareness in these comments. Let me hit you all with some knowledge: the N word is not okay to say because it has body counts and a huge amount of human suffering attached to it. The word goes back to slave owning days, same as the N word with no hard r. Black folks can say the word because it is theirs to reclaim. I'm a person of color and that word is not in my vocabulary. Why? Because I'm not black, and I'm aware of the oppression tied to this word. I'm also not a piss baby arguing why I should be able to use such a gross word because again, this word is not mine to reclaim. So yeah, it's fine when all these black rappers use the word because it's a part of their personal history. As a grown ass woman I am still in disbelief that people can't have a pinch of empathy for their fellow human beings. If you're not black, you are irrelevant in the conversation of whether you can say the n word. You can't, bottom line, and if you're still arguing your right to say it, well then I have news for you: you're a racist.",0,0

cLdxuaxaQwc,Other streamers do the same thing and don't apologize. Here is a prime example of a truly moral person he tries so hard even censors himself to try and be a good example but he makes one tiny mistake and they attack him.  I saw an example where a teachers writes the time tables for 9 he starts by writing 9x1=10 then writes the rest right. The kids make fun because he got one wrong but fail to acknowledge that the rest are correct it goes to show people will quickly make fun of your mistakes but ignore your accomplishments.

Y'all are disgusting for backing up your problematic fave and I'm pretty sure he did this before. Pewdiepie is canceled.",0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,And this could in all honestly become a good thing for you. You sit on a platform where you could really educate people especially when so many of your fans seem to think it's okay to be said.

cLdxuaxaQwc,"OK guys i get that the word was once used as a demeaning term and that the history of that word will never change, yes pewds fucked up but still it quite obviously wasn't his intention to use the word in a racist way. And those people overreacting are making it easier for toxic media influencers  to fuck every single content creator because they are blowing this out of proportion, pewds is not a racist.",0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,pewdiepie had nothing to be sorry about.  everybody who is mad at him need to get their head out of their ass and get over themselves.  or maybe when a black person makes an offensive remark about a white person i should call them racist and see how they like it.  turn about is fair play.,0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,I think other YouTube's who are hatting at him are just jealous that he is bigger than them. I think yes it was wronge for him to say it but common give this guy a break ok I have heard this word said by black people daily if they can say it why can't white people why so sensitive. I am Indian and have heard Sooo much rasisum from every body including black and white people. This is outrageous I am pissed and not happy u can clearly see he was hyped up at the time when he said this can't u actually just support him and understand that he is a human as well,0,0

cLdxuaxaQwc,i think its funny how he said one word and all of the sudden its the end of the world i get it words hurt but you all need to grow up honestly because i can say this the fact that you get offended by a word is dissapointing like seriously theres so much worse one youtube but no one does anything about that grow up!! and at least he had the decency to own up to what you did he said this to everyone in the entire world lets you get on camara and apologize infront of millions of people i bet you cant do it..,0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,"I am not angry at you at all.  And you shouldn't have to apologize.  The way I see it, if it's such a bad word then NO ONE should be using it.  Not just white people.  I support you Pewds!",0,0

cLdxuaxaQwc,To the people saying that since black people say it why does it matter if another race says it this is one of many reasons why our society is shit now. It doesn't matter if black says it that doesn't justify other groups using the term shit like that doesn't just slip out that's the worst word you can think of ?

I haven't even seen the clip but from what I've heard and from what I know about Pewds from watching him for years, I can conclude it wasn't meant to be offensive. Lots of the time the word is used now (or its variants), it's not meant to be racist or worth getting offended over. Although, I don't get why people have this weird obsession with saying it. While context does matter, regardless, it's a word with a shitty history and unnecessary to use. When people have a fixation with the word it weirds me out and makes me think they're closet racists. Do people think it's edgy or something? (I'm talking primarily about nigger, not nigga because that word has a totally different connotation)",0,0

There's no need to be sensitive, but if you're accidentally racist on several occasions it's not an accident and you're actually racist. I've never ever said the n word, because from a white person that's a terribly hurtful word, and with the black family members that I have, I would never want my young cousins to hear the word that came out of this mans mouth, especially since he's an influencer. Now I'm going to be hearing it more, and then hear well pewdiepie said it, so can I. It's not okay, and it's not something you say in the heat of the moment, it only slips out if you frequently say it. I think I gotta give up on defending this. I've been subscribed for like 6 years.

Why if we have the technology of cloud seeding through laser shooting at particles to create rain and we been manipulating the weather for decades now. Why didn't we redirected or stopped the hurricanes? \n\nEven famous physicists Michio Kaku admits to this geoengenering on a cbs news interview.  \nI wish it didn't happen and all natural disasters are a horrible thing for anyone to endure. And my heart goes out to all the victims and will continue to support. But it is so sad to find out that tragic events like this can be man made at times. So I pray that many of you become aware of what's really taking place in this reality and give your life to God, he won't disappoint you. \nAnd I pray that this whole event about helping is not just an agenda to promote and push coexistence, globalism and unity. Their religion of occult  New Age/mysticism and rise of their Antichrist/alien god to bring their New World Order, which they believe, chaos must be created in order to bring Order. Where with their mind witch powers and advance alien/demon technology they can create  almost anything they can imagine. \nDon't get me wrong please, helping is awesome as I'm praying for everyone including the celebrities participating and even those who have sold their souls for riches and fame, is not to late for redemption! I'm praying for you. But really hope this is not all orchestrated for a different agenda, don't forget that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Time to read our Bibles and take a close look at  the book of Revelation chapter 13,  Daniel 12 and Luke 21.\nStay strong Texas, Florida, all the Caribbean and to all those affected. May you find peace and joy in Christ Jesus even in the middle of the struggles. Remember man and Satan  can only hurt the physical body or the material but can't never have our souls if we believe we are Gods children and the only way to be redeemed and adopted into Gods family is by Jesus Christ our Savior, there's no short cuts and Satan is a liar so don't fall for the lies because religion kills and condemns the soul, only a true relationship with Father God through Jesus saves.

vu_9muoxT50,"Hello, I am Theresa Williams After being in relationship with Anderson for years, he broke up with me, I did everything possible to bring him back but all was in vain, I wanted him back so much because of the love I have for him, I begged him with everything, I made promises but he refused. I explained my problem to my friend and she suggested that I should rather contact a spell caster that could help me cast a spell to bring him back but I am the type that never believed in spell, I had no choice than to try it, I mailed the spell caster, and he told me there was no problem that everything will be okay before three days, that my ex will return to me before three days, he cast the spell and surprisingly in the second day, it was around 4 pm. My ex called me, I was so surprised, I answered the call and all he said was that he was so sorry for everything that happened that he wanted me to return to him, that he loves me so much. I was so happy and went to him that was how we started living together happily again. Since then, I have made promise that anybody I know that have a relationship problem, I would be of help to such person by referring him or her to the only real and powerful spell caster who helped me with my own problem.

vu_9muoxT50,"Whenever a magician needs to touch something, that's usually where the magic occurs. Unfortunately for Colin, the camera angle right before he asks Heidi to say stop reveals a white item cupped in his right hand (this is of course the magical list of 3 items - Rome/Cheese/Ellen - about to be pressed onto the printed paper wherever she says stop). To see this white item, you'll have to watch the DVR version of the TV broadcast as this internet version has been edited by AGT to remove this reveal. At 03:06, Colin brings this small piece of paper from his right pocket with his right hand. It's all actually a simple slight-of-hand trick performed with far more flair and advance video preparation than wily subterfuge.\n\nAlways be suspicious when a magician needs to touch something with any part of their body or any device they are holding.

And then they way he talks and the way he looks and how humble he is. And I also like how he's not a singer. He's such a good presenter that when Heidi and simon new what was going on they didn't buzz probably because they didn't want to spoil it for america right when they are so happy and anticipated. \n\nAlso it's pretty impressive that howie ordered a Ellen Burger and just everything that happened was impressive.,0,0

1L7JFN7tQLs,Jonathan Morrison and iJustine want the silver X. Classic look. I know what Jon Rettinger is getting... 😉\n\nLess fingerprints will be shown in most indoor lighting.\n\nCan be recognized easily as a X with the vertical camera hump and not be mistaken as a black 7 from afar. \n\nKinda a throwback to the two-toned original iPhone that helped launch their YouTube/tech career.\n\nSilver X it is.  Even my space gray SE isn't consistently all black from front and back and it's the most beautiful iPhone ever made.,0,0

1L7JFN7tQLs,"I thought this was a good offering from Apple. It will be a well-executed device and likely be a big winner, sales wise (despite the price) even if they're just now catching up in some areas.  \n\nImpressed by:\n-chipset. They were already beating all competition here with the 7. Bench numbers look amazing and every day performance will likely follow suit. \n\n-software: photo options, UI with no home button looks super easy to adapt to\n\n-4K@60 and slomo. Damn tech is getting impressive across the board here. \n\n-fit and finish and presentation. The package is pleasing to me overall. I don't mind the notch at all. \n\nI was a bit disappointed by a few things:\n\n-screen brightness. Boo! \n-no promotion/120hz refresh\n-fuck 2x optical zoom. Samsung and Apple, get your shit together and give me something more useful here. \n\nI've owned both Apple and various android-based devices. In general, I find Apple to hold up better (lag less) and simply be a more fluid and enjoyable experience. Less buggy, more mainstream/supported and compatible with apps like e.g DJIgo4, etc. \n\nI'll probably wait for the next iteration of this one, but I like it. \n\nWhy has no mentioned the absence of the blush gold color option. That was a winner in my book, but not even a whisper? No one seems to be talking about it, especially after all the leaks.",0,0

UCrBICYM0yM,"How can people be excited about this crap? This makes absolutelly NO sense at all. First: Most catastrophes are not caused by overpopulation, but natural disasters. Even if you make the point of carrying capacity in terms of food becoming a problem, it could be tackled by GMOs easier and better. Second: You CAN NOT just shrink people down like this. The size of nucleons are unalterable, because the ranges of the strong and weak nuclear forces are fundamental constants. Reducing the space between nuclei and electrons is impossible because of electromagnetism. And even packing molecules tighter together wouldn't work, as there'd be biochemical problems. Correct protein folding and therefore enzymes would be rendered impossible. Third: How could they metabolize food and drinks not their own size? Their tiny enzymes wouldn't work on normal-sized molecules. I'd say if you can alter the fundamental universal constants, carrying capacity is no worry any longer, you're basically beyond even a kardashev III civilization by then. \n\nThis isn't even original, as some say. The shrinking trope has been done to death!\nAnd before someone points out this is supposed to be a comedy: Even a comedy needs suspension of disbelief. Also, it may be because I hate Hollywood comedy to the death, but at least for me they're always the same. Clichee-filled crude humor fests with plots of idiocy.

Among other felonies, he was the head bombmaker for a terror group, the FALN, that claimed credit for 120 bomb attacks, killing six and injuring dozens.

QBGaO89cBMI,"Radiohead ha estrenado un nuevo videoclip para su canción “Lift“, uno de los temas inéditos incluidos en el lanzamiento de OKNOTOK, la reedición de Ok Computer por su vigésimo aniversario, que se puso a la venta en junio. Se trata de una de las canciones que quedaron guardadas cuando la banda británica estaba componiendo uno de los álbumes más influyentes de su carrera: El OK Computer (1997).\nDos décadas después, el tema vio la luz en OKNOTOK. La reedición incluye el disco original, las 8 caras b y tres temas inéditos que el grupo ha tocado en directo pero cuyas versiones de estudio jamás han visto la luz. Estas son “Man of War” y “I Promise“ y Lift, todas ya con su correspondiente nuevo vídeoclip.\nLas imágenes de Lift están dirigidas por el británico Oscar Hudson, que ha trabajado con la banda desde el lanzamiento de A Moon Shaped Pool (2016). En este vídeoclip vemos un surrealista viaje en ascensor protagonizado por el vocalista del grupo, Thom Yorke.  En el trayecto se encuentra con diversos personajes y situaciones, pero como se indica en la canción, no todo es lo que parece.\nMúsica independiente novedades.",0,0
